/**
 * **Deprecated:** The `/actuator/trace` endpoint was removed in Spring Boot 2.2.0 and later due to security concerns and bugs.
 * <p>
 * Use the `/actuator/httpexchange` endpoint instead. It offers a more secure and controlled way to access HTTP exchange information.
 * <p>
 * **Custom HttpExchangeRepository:** Since the default settings weren't suitable for the `/actuator/httpexchange` endpoint in this application,
 * a custom `InMemoryHttpExchangeRepository` bean was created.
